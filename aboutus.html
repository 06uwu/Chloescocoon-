        <h2>About Chloë's Cocoon</h2>
        <p> Hii, I'm Chloë. At night I'm an influencer for Asian beauty products on tiktok and during the day
            you can find me at school studying digital design. I created this website to see the potential interest for Chinese-style dresses,
            a fashion niche I'm deeply passionate about. My love for these fairy-like, feminine dresses has recently been
            going up! It's a part of my journey in feminine energy and reclaiming that. Finding such unique pieces in Europe has always been a challenge. This website is not just a
            one-time project; it's hopefully the beginning of a continuous journey to bring beautiful, enchanting dresses to those
            who share my appreciation for them. Xxx Chloë</p>
